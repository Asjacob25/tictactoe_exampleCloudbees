The following test cases are designed to verify the changes made in your Python code where actions/checkout and actions/setup-python are updated to their latest versions.

Test Case 1: Verify Checkout Version
- Test Step: Run `actions/checkout@v3` in the workflow.
- Expected Result: The action should run successfully without any errors.

Test Case 2: Verify Setup Python Version
- Test Step: Run `actions/setup-python@v4` in the workflow.
- Expected Result: The action should run successfully without any errors.

Test Case 3: Verify Python Environment Setup
- Test Step: After running `actions/setup-python@v4`, check the Python version using `python --version`.
- Expected Result: The version should correspond to the one set up by `actions/setup-python@v4`.

Test Case 4: Verify Compatibility of Checkout with Other Actions
- Test Step: Run `actions/checkout@v3` along with other actions in your workflow.
- Expected Result: All actions should run successfully without any conflicts or errors.

Test Case 5: Verify Compatibility of Setup Python with Other Actions
- Test Step: Run `actions/setup-python@v4` along with other actions in your workflow.
- Expected Result: All actions should run successfully without any conflicts or errors.

Test Case 6: Verify Error Handling
- Test Step: Intentionally cause an error in `actions/checkout@v3` or `actions/setup-python@v4`.
- Expected Result: The workflow should fail gracefully, providing a clear and concise error message regarding the issue.

Test Case 7: Verify Workflow Success
- Test Step: Run a complete workflow using `actions/checkout@v3` and `actions/setup-python@v4`.
- Expected Result: The workflow should complete successfully without any errors.

Please note that these test cases are designed to check the functionality of GitHub actions and not the Python code itself. The actual Python code test cases may vary depending on the specific functionality of your application.
